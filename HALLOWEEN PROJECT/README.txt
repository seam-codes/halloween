Halloween Website
-----------------
This Halloween website is a submission for httpswww.w3schools.com Halloween Event held in October 2022 in Discord.

Halloween
---------
My httpshalloween69.netlify.app is an documentary where you can know about Halloween.
I’ve used HTML5 and CSS3 and it’s a responsive website.
1. There are 4 pages. (Home, About, Gallery, Movies)
2. In the Home page there is nothing special. Just a wishing line and a Explore button.
3. On the About page there are some question and answer that tells you what Halloween is.
4. In the gallery section there are some cute Halloween images; if you click on those images, it gives you the full version of those images, and then you can also download them.
5. On the movie page there are some movies that are related to Halloween and you can also watch them I give their IMDB links in the name you can explore those movies in IMDB by clicking the name.

Problem
-------
The navbar is not auto-closing you have to close the navbar and the website is not fully responsive. On the image and movie section on mobile is more margin at the bottom I can’t fix this problem for short time and I am a student because of that I can’t do code more time in a day.
